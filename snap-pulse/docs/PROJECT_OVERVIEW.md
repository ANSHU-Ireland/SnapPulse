# SnapPulse Project Overview

## 🎯 Mission Statement

SnapPulse solves the "Snap Store black box" problem by providing comprehensive, self-hosted analytics that give developers and users the transparency they've been requesting on Reddit and forums.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Microservices Design

```

### Technology Stack
- **Orchestration:** Juju 3.6 + MicroK8s 1.32
- **Data Pipeline:** Feast 0.46 + snapstore-client + asyncio
- **API Layer:** FastAPI + OpenSearch + CORS
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + Tailwind + Chart.js + SWR
- **AI/ML:** Transformers + BitsAndBytes + Mistral-7B
- **Packaging:** Charmed Operators + Snap packaging

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Four Microservices
- ✅ **Collector:** Pulls Snap Store data every 30 minutes
- ✅ **API:** RESTful endpoints with automatic OpenAPI docs
- ✅ **Dashboard:** Real-time analytics with beautiful charts
- ✅ **Copilot:** AI suggestions via GitHub webhook integration

### 2. Cloud-Native Deployment
- ✅ **Charmed Operators:** Each service as a Juju charm
- ✅ **Bundle Configuration:** One-command deployment
- ✅ **MicroK8s Integration:** Container orchestration
- ✅ **Snap Package:** Self-contained installer

### 3. Developer Experience
- ✅ **Automated Deployment:** `./scripts/deploy.sh`
- ✅ **Demo Data Generation:** `./scripts/seed_demo.py`
- ✅ **Smoke Testing:** `./scripts/smoke-test.sh`
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation:** README + Development Guide

## 🎤 Interview Demonstration Flow

### 1. Community Empathy (2 minutes)
> *"I saw repeated Reddit complaints about Snap Store opacity. The community wants download counts, crash rates, and adoption metrics that help developers and users make informed decisions."*

### 2. Product Vision (2 minutes)
> *"SnapPulse provides self-hosted analytics that developers can customize and own. When developers see that snap install moves the needle, they'll publish faster, growing the Ubuntu ecosystem."*

### 3. Technical Demo (5 minutes)

```bash
# Show project structure
tree snap-pulse/

# Deploy with one command
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Show all services running
juju status

# Test API endpoints
curl http://api-ip:8000/stats/firefox/stable
curl http://api-ip:8000/trending

# Show dashboard
open http://dashboard-ip:3000

# Demonstrate copilot
# (Comment "/snappulse fix" on GitHub repo)
```

### 4. Technical Deep Dive (3 minutes)
> *"This demonstrates fluency with the full Canonical stack: charmed operators for cloud-native deployment, Juju models for orchestration, MicroK8s for container management, and Feast for feature store patterns."*

### 5. Extensibility Discussion (3 minutes)
- Add crash reporting integration
- Implement user retention analytics
- Expand AI features for marketing suggestions
- Connect with Launchpad and GitHub Actions
